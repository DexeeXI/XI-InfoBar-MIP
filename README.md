# XI-InfoBar-MIP
Infobar Monster Improvement Program
Welcome to what will hopefully be a long term home for the InfoBar Database Monster Improvement Program for Final Fantasy XI.

The purpose behind this program is to provide for long term support for the database that is used as part of InfoBar.

All contents of this readme are subject to change. Please review the readme at Github to verify you have the latest Readme.

## Instructions
### How to Edit the Database
1) Download the database.db.sql from the main branch
2) Using your favorite SQL program, import the SQL file (or edit it directly if you like that)
3) Edit entries in the database. If you need to add a monster that is not included at all, any programs' "insert new record" should place it firmly at the bottom with the "latest" index and id number.
4) When done, save your changes and export the database as a SQL file.

### How to submit to the Monster Improvement Program
1) Upload the updated SQL file to a separate branch or a fork.
2) Create a PR on the github located at https://github.com/DexeeXI/XI-InfoBar-MIP and link the PR to the branch or fork the purposes of submission.

### How to use/test an updated monster SQL file
note: There may be periods where neither myself nor anyone else is going to post an "up to date" database.db file for a quick download and use. This is how one sets up and uses an SQL file.
1) Download a copy of the latest database.db.sql
2) Using your favorite SQL program, import the SQL file.
3) Save the resulting database as "database.db"
4) Navigate to your Windower/addons/Infobar folder. Create a backup of database.db located within.
5) Copy/move the database.db file generated to your Windower/Addons/Infobar folder and overwrite the database.db file within.
6) If FFXI is already running, all you should need to do is (re)target a foe. Changes will be visible immediately as the LUA script for Infobar does not require a reload for a change in the database. If things do not appear correctly, issue a //lua r Infobar to ensure the script is working correctly.
7) If any bugs are noticed with the display of information, let us know so we can double check and make sure it is our problem and not Infobar's
